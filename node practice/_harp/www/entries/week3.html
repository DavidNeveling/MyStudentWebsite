I let work for other classes pile up and eventually got overwhelmed in doing it all at the last minute. All of that led to me not doing much work for this one. I mainly tried to understand certain features that we when over like Docker and Gitlab-CI, but most of that didn’t directly translate to working on the project. I did enjoy going over more about how Python works. I picked it up last Spring Break and it has since become my favorite language, but I never really tried to learn it very in depth and just solved problems as they arose. It’s nice to learn a bunch of small things so I can avoid problems I know I would’ve had otherwise.</p>
<h2>What’s in your way?</h2><p>I have a really bad habit of being short sighted and procrastinating. I almost never miss deadlines, but it does result in a lot of unnecessary stress. I’ve also had some trouble getting to bed at a reasonable time which makes it harder to bring myself to work on something I don’t want to.</p>
<h2>What will you do next week?</h2><p>Finish this Collatz project. I have a couple other assignments due around the same time, but if I manage my time properly I’ll have no trouble getting everything done.</p>
<h2>What’s your experience of the in-class exercises?</h2><p>I only remember one that the students each engaged in which was on HackerRank. My laptop doesn’t work currently and HackerRank doesn’t work on mobile so it’s kind of a pain, but the exercise itself was decent. I got cold-called on at a very unfortunate time since I was having really bad stomach pain that day. Although, I found it funny after the fact and I know I won’t forget what we went over.</p>
<h2>What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2><p>One thing I’ve always disliked to write are parsers for anything. For anyone in the same boat I’d recommend looking into the parsing modules in Python like csv and HTMLParser. If there isn’t already a parser for what you want to do you can look into PLY (Python Lex-Yacc). I used it for a project a while ago where I converted one language into another and, not only did it work fast, it also didn’t take much time to write once I knew what the steps were.</p></body></html>
