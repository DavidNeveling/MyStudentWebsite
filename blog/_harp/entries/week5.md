# CS 373 Fall 2018 Week 5

## What did you do this past week?

AI and Algorithms kept me pretty busy, but even when I couldn't contribute I was still at a bare minimum keeping track of project developments my group was making. I'm not very experienced at this kind of work so I mainly let most of the larger decisions go to people who knew more about web development. This resulted in us using a bunch of technologies I know nothing about. I've been reviewing everything we're using and have been a little lost for a while. It's starting to come together and I'm definitely learning a lot as a result of this project, it's just been more of a hassle than I expected.

## What's in your way?

My lack of knowledge on the subjects is one thing. It seems like there a million different options when exploring web development and sorting through the ones available and finding how everything works together is a bit of a pain. I also didn't judge how long certain assignments were going to take me which gave me less time to work on the project for this class.

## What will you do next week?

The beginning is gonna be pretty busy. A test on Monday and a project on Tuesday is never a fun combination. However, after that I'll actually have a good deal of free time. I need to make a decision on whether or not I want to use that time to get ahead and make my work easier or just mess around and destress. It'll most likely be the latter.

## What's your experience of the readings, so far? And, if you went, what did you think of the talk by Under Armour? (this question will vary, week to week)

It was dumped on me midweek that some family was coming into to town Friday. Because of that I couldn't actually make it to the Under Armour talk even though I thought it might be interesting. As far the readings are concerned they've been decent. I've covered some of the topics talked about in other classes but the readings forced me to go over them in greater detail. Thought it seems like we're getting into stuff that I'm much less knowledgeable on which could make them more enjoyable.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

This question gets harder and harder every week.
