# CS 373 Fall 2018 Week 7

## What did you do this past week?

I learned a good deal more about Python. I had no idea about some of the things you could do with the language. I had to look over a lot of the stuff in my free time because I didn't think I'd remember everything I needed to by the test just by treating class the same way I have been. I am really glad I'm learning this though, a lot of it seems really helpful. Other than just going over the more complicated stuff we went over in the last week I've been basically just looking through everything I've put in my journal and whatever shows in the files on the schedule.

## What’s in your way?

Nothing much at this point. My schedule has actually been very free for once so I took advantage of the time I had, got some rest, and worked on some stuff I felt like working on. I guess I'm also uncertain of what all I need to focus on for the test. I feel like just studying everything evenly probably won't help me too much. I never really started to study until college so my study habits still aren't the best.

## What will you do next week?

Hopefully get an A on the test. In addition, we're going to be covering some new stuff in class. I like Python a lot so I'm a little sad that we're moving on, but I think I'll live. I also have another test in a different class which I haven't been giving all that much attention so I'm not really looking forward to that.

## What was your experience of learning the basics of Python?

I liked it a lot. It made me feel really stupid for writing code the way I did for some other projects, but I'm way more confident in Python now as a result. In my opinion, there's nothing wrong with Googling how to do certain things as long as it isn't blatant plagiarism. But now that I'm much more familiar I don't have to Google as much which is always nice.

## What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I really don't have anything left for these. I guess a tip would be to revisit technologies that you have worked very minimally on. I always have a problem where I can learn things just fine, but if I don't keep my knowledge updated I'll just forget almost everything.
