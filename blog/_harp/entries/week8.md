# CS 373 Fall 2018 Week 8

## What did you do this past week?

I took our first test in this class and then got pretty sick not long after. Unfortunately getting sick prevented me from getting to some classes, but I got better by the end of the week to learn about relational algebra. I learned a fair amount of SQL and SPARQL in my Database Management class so this stuff isn't completely foreign to me, but its interesting to learn from a different angle than I was taught originally.

## What’s in your way?

The fact that I didn't check the weather since I was running late was a big issue for me. Although I found out that my phone has a setting on my alarm which will tell me the weather when it goes off so I think having that on would help at least a bit.

## What will you do next week?

Its beginning to narrow in on the deadline for our next project so I'm gonna be doing work with my group to make sure we have no problems getting everything done. I have some studying to do for another midterm, but other than that I think I won't be too busy with other things.

## What was your experience of Test 1 (the problems, the time, HackerRank)?

I won't know completely until after I get my score, but I was fine with it. I was getting in my own head before it started, trying to review every bit of notes we took and it was starting to worry me. Luckily it was all programming questions which I much prefer since I have a terrible memory. The time and HackerRank were both fine, I just wish I owned a decent laptop. The laptop I was using decided to stop connecting to internet for no reason so I to restart my computer in the middle of the test. Fortunately, HackerRank saved my progress and the time of the test was generous enough to let me still finish in time.

## What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I'm the type of person that **loves** to listen to music while I work on anything. For anyone else that is the same I would recommend the soundtrack for Hyper Light Drifter, the soundtrack for Endless Space 2, and anything by Emancipator. There are many more recommendations I could make, but those are what I have been listening to recently.
