# CS 373 Fall 2018 Week 4

## What did you do this past week?

I finished up the first project. This weeks classes were definitely different. I ended up getting sick the first day, but I learned quite a bit each of the other days. Also ended up finally setting up some kind of blog that wasn't some random website. I'm not the biggest fan of having to keep track of a million different accounts.

## What's in your way?

Same stuff as usual. Balancing my Algorithms homework after pushing the project back a little too much proved to not be very fun. I sometimes end up getting pretty fixated an certain things that have nothing to with school and I completely lose track of time.

## What will you do next week?

I have to finish an AI assignment that I've been working on, but after that I'll have plenty of time to figure things for this class out with my group. I'm still not entirely sure what to do for the project, but I plan to brainstorm and eventually find something decent to work with. This will be the first time I'm working in a group that doesn't have anybody that I've know prior, so it'll be a learning experience.

## What was your experience of Project 1 (the problem, the overkill requirements of submission, etc.)?

The actual HackerRank problem itself wasn't too bad. I submitted code that passed all the tests pretty quickly. The things that actually took all my time were the GitLab components. I spent a few hours on all the set up, keeping track of issues, making my commits meaningful, etc. I've used git on plenty of stuff before this, but I haven't really cared to make issues and be very thorough. I also had some gitlab and docker issues. I figured out how to use it just fine, but I started getting a weird error about volume specifications that kept breaking my builds that I never ended up being able to fix.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Virtual machines are a lot of fun. Whenever I have an idea that could potentially break a computer I generally make a virtual machine in Oracle's VirtualBox and play around. It's also nice to have a true linux environment since my PC runs windows. Docker can give you the linux terminal, but I just like the extra freedom.
