This weeks classes were definitely different. I ended up getting sick the first day, but I learned quite a bit each of the other days. Also ended up finally setting up some kind of blog that wasn&#39;t some random website. I&#39;m not the biggest fan of having to keep track of a million different accounts.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s in your way?</h2><p>Same stuff as usual. Balancing my Algorithms homework after pushing the project back a little too much proved to not be very fun. I sometimes end up getting pretty fixated an certain things that have nothing to with school and I completely lose track of time.</p>
<h2>What will you do next week?</h2><p>I have to finish an AI assignment that I&#39;ve been working on, but after that I&#39;ll have plenty of time to figure things for this class out with my group. I&#39;m still not entirely sure what to do for the project, but I plan to brainstorm and eventually find something decent to work with. This will be the first time I&#39;m working in a group that doesn&#39;t have anybody that I&#39;ve know prior, so it&#39;ll be a learning experience.</p>
<h2>What was your experience of Project 1 (the problem, the overkill requirements of submission, etc.)?</h2><p>The actual HackerRank problem itself wasn&#39;t too bad. I submitted code that passed all the tests pretty quickly. The things that actually took all my time were the GitLab components. I spent a few hours on all the set up, keeping track of issues, making my commits meaningful, etc. I&#39;ve used git on plenty of stuff before this, but I haven&#39;t really cared to make issues and be very thorough. I also had some gitlab and docker issues. I figured out how to use it just fine, but I started getting a weird error about volume specifications that kept breaking my builds that I never ended up being able to fix.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2><p>Virtual machines are a lot of fun. Whenever I have an idea that could potentially break a computer I generally make a virtual machine in Oracle&#39;s VirtualBox and play around. It&#39;s also nice to have a true linux environment since my PC runs windows. Docker can give you the linux terminal, but I just like the extra freedom.</p></body></html>
