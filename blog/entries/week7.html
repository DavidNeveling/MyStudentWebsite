I had no idea about some of the things you could do with the language. I had to look over a lot of the stuff in my free time because I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d remember everything I needed to by the test just by treating class the same way I have been. I am really glad I&#39;m learning this though, a lot of it seems really helpful. Other than just going over the more complicated stuff we went over in the last week I&#39;ve been basically just looking through everything I&#39;ve put in my journal and whatever shows in the files on the schedule.</p>
<h2>What’s in your way?</h2><p>Nothing much at this point. My schedule has actually been very free for once so I took advantage of the time I had, got some rest, and worked on some stuff I felt like working on. I guess I&#39;m also uncertain of what all I need to focus on for the test. I feel like just studying everything evenly probably won&#39;t help me too much. I never really started to study until college so my study habits still aren&#39;t the best.</p>
<h2>What will you do next week?</h2><p>Hopefully get an A on the test. In addition, we&#39;re going to be covering some new stuff in class. I like Python a lot so I&#39;m a little sad that we&#39;re moving on, but I think I&#39;ll live. I also have another test in a different class which I haven&#39;t been giving all that much attention so I&#39;m not really looking forward to that.</p>
<h2>What was your experience of learning the basics of Python?</h2><p>I liked it a lot. It made me feel really stupid for writing code the way I did for some other projects, but I&#39;m way more confident in Python now as a result. In my opinion, there&#39;s nothing wrong with Googling how to do certain things as long as it isn&#39;t blatant plagiarism. But now that I&#39;m much more familiar I don&#39;t have to Google as much which is always nice.</p>
<h2>What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2><p>I really don&#39;t have anything left for these. I guess a tip would be to revisit technologies that you have worked very minimally on. I always have a problem where I can learn things just fine, but if I don&#39;t keep my knowledge updated I&#39;ll just forget almost everything.</p></body></html>
