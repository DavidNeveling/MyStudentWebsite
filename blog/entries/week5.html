I&#39;m not very experienced at this kind of work so I mainly let most of the larger decisions go to people who knew more about web development. This resulted in us using a bunch of technologies I know nothing about. I&#39;ve been reviewing everything we&#39;re using and have been a little lost for a while. It&#39;s starting to come together and I&#39;m definitely learning a lot as a result of this project, it&#39;s just been more of a hassle than I expected.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s in your way?</h2><p>My lack of knowledge on the subjects is one thing. It seems like there a million different options when exploring web development and sorting through the ones available and finding how everything works together is a bit of a pain. I also didn&#39;t judge how long certain assignments were going to take me which gave me less time to work on the project for this class.</p>
<h2>What will you do next week?</h2><p>The beginning is gonna be pretty busy. A test on Monday and a project on Tuesday is never a fun combination. However, after that I&#39;ll actually have a good deal of free time. I need to make a decision on whether or not I want to use that time to get ahead and make my work easier or just mess around and destress. It&#39;ll most likely be the latter.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s your experience of the readings, so far? And, if you went, what did you think of the talk by Under Armour? (this question will vary, week to week)</h2><p>It was dumped on me midweek that some family was coming into to town Friday. Because of that I couldn&#39;t actually make it to the Under Armour talk even though I thought it might be interesting. As far the readings are concerned they&#39;ve been decent. I&#39;ve covered some of the topics talked about in other classes but the readings forced me to go over them in greater detail. Thought it seems like we&#39;re getting into stuff that I&#39;m much less knowledgeable on which could make them more enjoyable.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2><p>After recently having an interview I can say that you should treat them as a learning experience. That isn&#39;t to say don&#39;t take them seriously, but gather as much information as you can from the interviewers. The people interviewing me were actually very informative and I came out of the process knowing much more about what kind of environment goes in to this kind of work.</p></body></html>
