We went over some basic testing methods in Python as well as Collatz project tips and logistics. I have done a little bit of work on the project, which mainly consisted of copy-and-pasting what I had already written for a similar problem and altering to work correctly within the files that were given. Every time I tried to start on the other parts I kept missing small instructions since I was rushing. After that I decided to put the project off until we went over it more in lecture.</p>
<h2>What’s in your way?</h2><p>Most of my issues come from my habit of rushing things. My schedule currently gives me plenty of time to work on material for every class I have, I just need to make sure I sit down and do it. I also need to make sure I keep some kind of planner, since I’ve already missed a couple things. I’ve tried to in the past, but it has never become a habit for me.</p>
<h2>What will you do next week?</h2><p>I’m going to make sure I work on the project a little each day so that I don’t stress myself out unnecessarily.</p>
<h2>What’s your experience of the class?</h2><p>I already have some experience with what we have been working with (Python, git, etc.) so I have yet to feel overwhelmed by anything as far as the material is concerned. I have done a lot of Project Euler problems in the past, so I found it funny when the Collatz project was revealed since it is nearly identical to problem 14 which I did in Python. The project seems unnecessarily tedious to me. I understand that that is the point, but I still don’t like it.</p>
<h2>What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2><p>I would say my tip would be to constantly look for things you find interesting. Many people I know, including myself, run into creative blocks when trying to make a game, a website, or anything. The number one thing I’ve found to help push through that is finding something that you feel would be a nice addition to whatever you are making. This has time and time again helped me finish many projects, even the ones I had stopped years ago.</p></body></html>
